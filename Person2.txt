Welcome to the GitHub Workshop!
Hello Mr. Fails,

	I'd like to inform you that because of our introduction has only increased expectations
for our future selves. Before my graduation I fully expect you to have taken over the VT Git Club
and have become president. If not I will be disappoint. 


	Best of Luck,
		Andrew Chen
