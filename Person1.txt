Welcome to the GitHub Workshop!
Yes hello my name is Wyatt Fails and I am editing the person 1 file.

Mr. Chen,
	I am writing to inform you that I am going to join the git club
at Virginia Tech if it is the last thing I do in this mortal life. I have
made it the one thing I will do at this school. All energy that I had for 
any homework, social events, extracurricular activities, etc. is now focused
on joining this exclusive club. I will keep you posted via face to face interaction
on the off chance that I see you again after tonight. 

Good night, and good luck
Wyatt Fails
